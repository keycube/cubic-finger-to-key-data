Cubic Finger-to-Key Preference and Reachability

## Dataset
A user study was conducted to identify and measure the preferred and reachable key ares from the fingers when the users hold a cubic-shaped device in diagonal position. The participants (N=22) voluntarily gave their informed consent that their anonymized data will be collected, published and used for research purposes.

More information about the user study (participants, materials, procedure and results) are present on the paper `Supporting Mobility and Posture Diversity in Virtual Workspaces: Text Input with a Keycube`.

The dataset are released for scientific use. 

## Details
Both preferences and reachability dataset are released in `comma-separated values` (CSV) format and include the `handedness` (self-reported) as well as hands measurements (`circumference`, `length` and `span` in millimeters) of the participants.
